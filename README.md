# Can I GO?
## Introduction
Based on the team's research background in biosensors and data science, in this later period of the epidemic, most people have been vaccinated, but we don't know how our individual protection is. We plan to use personal body data, vaccination types, neutralizing antibodies, and the addition of surrounding infection cases as risk assessments, and provide a variety of personal protection calculation solutions, hoping to help the public understand their own situation and increase awareness of epidemic prevention.
